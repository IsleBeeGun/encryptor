# Encryptor

This is a simple webpage built with react. With it you can encrypt or decrypt any text by passing it to input text field. Just don't forget to set password, it will serve as an encryption key.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to use npm for installing Encryptor. I recommend installing it alongside with node.js:

[Install node](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installing

It's a react app with a bunch of additional modules, but basically all you need to do is to run nmp istall script after clonning the project. Here are your steps (perform in your desired folder) :

```
git clone https://github.com/IsleBeeGun/encryptor.git
```

```
cd ./encryptor
```

```
npm install
```

## Deployment

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
